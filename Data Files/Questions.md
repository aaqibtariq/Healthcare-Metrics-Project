# Staffing Metrics

-  Average nurse-to-patient ratio by hospital and state (over time)
(derived using total nursing hours and patient census)

-  Total hours worked by nurses per hospital, state, and time period (month/quarter)
(RN, LPN, CNA combined and individually)

-  Percentage of nurses working overtime (proxy-based)
(using contract hours and admin hours as overtime pressure indicators)

# Facility Metrics

-  Comparison of staffing levels vs. patient load
(identifies hospitals where staffing is misaligned with patient volume)

-  Facilities with the lowest staffing levels compared to patient load
(bottom-ranked hospitals based on staffing-to-census ratios)

-  Top hospitals by patient throughput (proxy-based)
(using cumulative patient census over time)

# Operational / Cost-Related Metrics

-  Ratio of permanent staff to temporary/contract staff
(employee vs. contract staffing mix)
