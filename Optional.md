# ⚠️ Files That Are PARTIALLY USEFUL (Optional / Advanced)

These are not required to meet the objective, but can be used for enrichment or correlation if you want to go slightly beyond minimum scope.

#  FY_2024_SNF_VBP_Facility_Performance.csv

Status: ⚠️ OPTIONAL

Could support:

High-level quality outcome correlation

Facility performance comparison

❗ But:

Not needed for staffing metrics

Not needed for workload analysis

#  NH_QualityMsr_Claims_Oct2024.csv

Status: ⚠️ OPTIONAL

Could support:

Weak proxy for quality outcomes

Exploratory correlation only

❗ Does not directly support:

Readmissions

LOS

Satisfaction (as defined in requirements)

#  NH_Ownership_Oct2024.csv

Status: ⚠️ OPTIONAL

Could support:

Ownership-based segmentation

Extra dashboard filter (for-profit vs non-profit)

👉 Nice-to-have, not core.


# Swing_Bed_SNF_data_Oct2024
✅ Usefulness: ⚠️ PARTIALLY (Context Only)

Why it can matter:

Identifies facility type / bed capability

Helps explain why patient load behaves differently at certain facilities

Can be used to segment hospitals (e.g., swing-bed vs standard SNF)

Why it’s NOT core:

❌ No staffing hours

❌ No census over time

❌ No nurse-level or workload data

❌ No usable bed counts for utilization math

Bottom line:

Use it only as a dimension enrichment
(e.g., filter / label facilities in dashboard)

👉 Not required to meet project goals

# Skilled_Nursing_Facility_Quality_Reporting_Program_Provider_Data_Oct2024
✅ Usefulness: ⚠️ PARTIALLY (Advanced / Optional)

Why it can matter:

Facility-level quality indicators

Can support high-level correlation analysis, such as:

“Facilities with lower staffing intensity tend to score worse on quality indicators”

Why it’s NOT core:

❌ Does NOT contain:

Readmission rates

Length of stay

Patient satisfaction

❌ Often lagging / aggregated

❌ Not operational or staffing-driven
